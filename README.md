# MIPS Architecture

This project utilized the MIPS architecture, which is a family of CPU instruction set architectures. MIPS architecture is a family of CPU instruction set architectures. It provides standardized instructions that 
can then be implemented and manufactured by other companies to make chips.

Notes: 
- The implementation of a datapath alongside an instruction interpreter is included within the presentation document.
- The implementable instructions can be found in the presentation document.
